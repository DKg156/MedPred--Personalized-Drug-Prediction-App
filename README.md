# MedPred--Personalized-Drug-Prediction-App
This GUI app was developed in Python using Spyder IDE. Once trained on a dataset, it can predict a suitable drug for a patient by taking personalized clinical parameters like age, sex, blood pressure, etc. Users can either use inbuilt dataset or import custom datasets for new disease predictions. User can also check the accuracy of the trained model and load the dataset being used by the app.
